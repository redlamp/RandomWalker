# RandomWalker ("Drunkard's Walk")
Recreating one of my favorite old Flash visualization projects in JavaScript.

Each cycle a walker takes a step in a random direction (without immediately stepping backwards, or out of range). This project maps the path of each walker on their route back to where they started. Once a Walker has returned to their origin their route is highlighted.
